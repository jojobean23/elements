			<p>You were made, not born. For some reason you have been crafted by a skilled tinkerer, wizard, engineer or other craftsman. Were you built for a war cresting the horizon? Was your maker a lonely hermit who made you as a companion, but died when (s)he finished? Are you an ancient guardian of a sacred location?</p>
						<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Choose 2, Arcana, History, Religion, Animal Handling, Insight, Performance.</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> One type of artisan’s tools</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Common clothes (if you appear humanoid), a pouch with 10gp, a sketchbook with your designs inside, Artificer’s Tools</li>
            </ul>
